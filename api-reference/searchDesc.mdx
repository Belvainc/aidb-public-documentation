"The Search endpoint allows users to query AiDB. By leveraging advanced vector and semantic search capabilities, 
this endpoint retrieves relevant data based on both structured queries and contextual similarity. The system processes 
requests by searching across vectorized contextually enhanced data, returning matched records that satisfy specified 
filters or keywords, optimizing for precision and context relevance. Users can refine their searches by specifying 
parameters like profileId, date ranges, and other metadata fields.

Search has two optional parameters, one for **chatHistory** and one for **linkedAccount**. Passing in chat history as opposed 
to a search query will allow the search value to be populated from the chat history. Therefore, you won't have to transform 
your conversational context into a search value as AiDB can handle this in real-time.

Likewise, **LinkedAccount** allows you to pass in a user account ID that's governed by you. So you can setup and manage an AiDB 
for millions of your customers at scale."
